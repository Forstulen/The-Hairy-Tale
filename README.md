The-Hairy-Tale
==============

This is my end of studies project made with 7 developers and 2 designers during 2 years with Unity3D. It was made since the conception to the marketing, the purpose was to create a project like a real professional project that includes reviews, documentation (technical, user, game design document), presentations and communication (Meeting, Facebook, Website)  Basically, it's a "Beat them all" online and offline (up to 4 players) and you must destroy everything on your path with light, heavy and combo attacks to save the Princess (déjà-vu?)
